<div class="about_head">
    <p>I am a Software Engineer II at Electronic Arts specializing in building cloud-based server infrastructure and platforms for social games. A lot of my work has been focused on writing scalable and distributed REST servers to support cross-platform games. I have also worked on writing client-server communications layers using thrift and JSON/Jackson. Prior to my work at EA I received my M.Math from the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. During this time I was a member of the Networks and Distributed Systems (NDS) research group specializing in Wireless Networks and voice over IP. I enjoy working with and writing about a wide variety of platforms using a host of different technologies including erlang, java, maven, thrift, jackson to name a few. You can find my detailed resume on LinkedIn and links to some of my work below. </p>
